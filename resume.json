      "summary": "While initially onboarding as a Product / Platform engineer for this email security startup, I ran into several (rather normal) startup issues including immature engineering culture, burgeoning technical debt, code rot, and poor production reliability. I was able to help plug these holes by creating documentation and implementing engineering and development best practices. This work on improving developer experience led to discussing production reliability shortcomings with the CTO and engineering managers.\nFollowing this proven positive impact, I was able to get C-level buy-in to create a dedicated Systems Reliability Team. As a founding member of this team, I helped hire and train Junior, Senior, and Principal engineers. My main goal was to get each member up to speed, able to progress as individual engineers, and to support the broader engineering org goals and milestones. With this fledgling SRE team, I worked to prioritize the following engineering goals:\n<ol><li>Automation of manual tasks in the production environment (as well as development and staging), primarily leveraging Stackstorm workflow/runbook automation services</li><li>Improved development workflow and maturing engineering culture with Bitbucket Pipelines and Jenkins CI/CD and improvements to in-house development environment Kubernetes / Helm management</li><li>Monitoring of application and infrastructure services with Prometheus and Grafana</li><li>Oncall rotation with actionable metrics & dashboards, detailed runbooks, and incident response procedures to improve detection of and response time to incidents in production systems</li><li>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) defining environments, clusters, services with reproducible Terraform, Helm, and ArgoCD code managed in understandable and testable Git repositories</li><li>Catch-all DevOps support for developers, QA engineers, and Customer Support staff who need help understanding, interacting with, fixing issues, as well as identifying common problems and developing solutions to prevent future recurrence</li></ol>",

Much of this work was on low-level performance tuning of queries to shared Cassandra and Redis databases.\nI gained a lot of monitoring and performance tuning skills by working with Atlassian's amazing embedded SRE team to:<ol><li>Implement custom metric gathering with Prometheus</li><li>Create performance & reliability monitoring dashboards in Honeycomb</li><li>Act as first line Oncall and service specific alerting and operations runbooks</li><li>Create automated CI/CD testing and full microservice load testing across staging environments</li><li>Have full ownership of the services release management, including GitOps for environment management and hotfixes</li></ol>",
